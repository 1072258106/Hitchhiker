As mention in [Script API](Script API.md), Hitchhiker support custom javascript libs.

In Project's menu, there is a item named Project Lib, it will pop a lib manager dialog like below:


You could find js lib that you want in NPM, pack it to zip file and upload it.

You can see it in the grid if file uploaded completely.

Then you can use function `require` in script to use this lib.

At first, we need create a Project for your API, let's name it `SampleAPI`:

We can invite team to join `SampleAPI`:
1. Click `Invite Members` button.
2. Enter emails split with `;`
3. Click OK button.

Now everyone you invited will receive a mail, they need click the button `Accept` in the mail to accept your invitation and join this project. Then you can see your team are in `SampleAPI` member list.

Only project's owner can remove member from this project. Owner also can disband project then every member will lose it and its collections.

Notice there is a `localhost` column that every member can edit it. It's used for debug your localhost API, `localhost` for server is server itself, you have to make server known where your computer are, so change `localhost` to your IP and when send a request with host `localhost`, server will change host to your IP that get from this mapping.
